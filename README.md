# Sparta_Global_Basic_Calculator

## Task
The task was to use JavaScript to produce a calculator using prompts that would allow the user to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers when the basic option was selected, as well as finding the square and root of numbers when the user wanted to apply more advanced methods to the numbers inputted.

## Functionality
For this project, no functions were used as I had only started learning JavaScript earlier in the day. As such all results were merely printed to the console.
